# Changelog

All notable changes to the coolify-mcp-server will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-30

### üéâ Major Release - Production Ready

This release represents a complete overhaul of the coolify-mcp-server with comprehensive improvements in architecture, API coverage, and reliability.

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Complete API Coverage
- **Projects**: Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- **Applications**: Enhanced with logs, command execution, full lifecycle management  
- **Databases**: Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis with full CRUD
- **Services**: Complete service lifecycle management with CRUD operations
- **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive management for all resource types
- **Private Keys**: Full key management with update and delete operations
- **Deployments**: Enhanced with webhook triggers and detailed logging

#### Pre-configured Prompts
- `deploy-git-app`: Deploy applications from Git repositories
- `setup-database`: Guided database setup with best practices
- `deploy-service`: Deploy pre-configured services (Plausible, Umami, etc.)
- `environment-setup`: Bulk environment variable configuration
- `server-health-check`: Comprehensive infrastructure health monitoring
- `backup-database`: Database backup workflows
- `scale-application`: Resource scaling and optimization
- `setup-ssl`: SSL/TLS configuration automation
- `migrate-application`: Cross-server application migration
- `troubleshoot-deployment`: Deployment issue diagnosis

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

#### Service Layer Pattern
- Extracted `CoolifyClient` class for centralized API communication
- Separated concerns between API logic and MCP tool definitions
- Comprehensive error handling with structured error types
- Robust response format handling for different Coolify versions

#### Tool Layer Enhancement
- Created `CoolifyTools` class wrapping service methods with MCP-specific logic
- Added Zod schema validation for all tool inputs
- Consistent error formatting for MCP responses
- Proper type safety throughout the stack

#### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all API entities (`types/coolify.ts`)
- Request/response types for each endpoint
- Proper error types with field-specific validation
- Full type coverage with strict TypeScript configuration

### üîß API Compatibility

#### Multi-Version Support
- **Version endpoint**: Handles both string (`"4.0.0-beta.418"`) and object responses
- **Health endpoint**: Adapts to string (`"OK"`) and structured health responses  
- **List endpoints**: Supports both direct arrays and paginated responses
- **Error handling**: Robust parsing of various error message formats

#### Response Format Adaptation
```typescript
// Automatic handling of different response formats
"4.0.0-beta.418" ‚Üí { version: "4.0.0-beta.418" }
[{...}, {...}] ‚Üí extractListData([{...}, {...}])
{ data: [{...}], meta: {...} } ‚Üí extractListData(response.data)
```

### üß™ Testing Infrastructure

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Tools layer validation and error handling (20 tests)
- **Integration Tests**: Real API calls against live Coolify instance (18 tests)
- **Total Coverage**: 38/38 tests passing with real-world validation

#### Test Environment
- Jest configuration with ES modules support
- Integration tests with live Coolify 4.0.0-beta.418 instance
- Automated CI-ready test structure
- Mock-free integration testing for maximum confidence

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience

#### Enhanced Development Tools
- TypeScript strict mode with full type safety
- Jest test framework with watch mode and coverage

- Optimized build process with executable permissions
- Production-ready Docker support
- NPM package with proper bin configuration

### üîß Infrastructure

#### Environment Variables
- `COOLIFY_BASE_URL`: Coolify instance URL
- `COOLIFY_TOKEN`: API token with required permissions
- Comprehensive validation and error reporting

#### Tool Coverage (43 tools total)
